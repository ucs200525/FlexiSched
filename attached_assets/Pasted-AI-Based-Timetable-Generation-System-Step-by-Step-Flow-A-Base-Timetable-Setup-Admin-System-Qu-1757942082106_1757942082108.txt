AI-Based Timetable Generation System (Step-by-Step Flow)
A. Base Timetable Setup (Admin → System Questions)
Before timetable generation, the Admin must configure the base framework by answering required questions:

Slot Configuration

Slot length (e.g., 50 min or 55 min) → depends on campus size & walking time between blocks.

Number of slots per day (e.g., 7, 8, or more).

Breaks/Lunch timings (fixed or flexible).

College working hours (e.g., 8:30 AM – 5:30 PM).

Credit Mapping to Slots

Define mapping:

1 credit → 1 slot per week.

2 credits → 2 slots per week.

Lab/Practical (2–3 credits) → consecutive slots.

Course Setup

Upload course list (Major, Minor, Skill, Ability Enhancement, Value Added).

Each course has → course code, credits, theory/lab split, expected student count.

System automatically maps required slots per week based on credits.

Faculty Setup

Assign faculty to each course.

Faculty availability (days, preferred slots, max workload hours/week).

Faculty specialization (only those who are eligible can teach).

Room/Lab Setup

Room details: capacity, location, availability.

Lab details: equipment-based allocation (e.g., Computer Lab for coding).

Tagging of rooms to specific courses (e.g., Chemistry → Lab Block, B.Ed. → Teaching Practice).

B. AI Allocation Flow (Python Optimization Engine)
Slot Assignment (Based on Credits)

System assigns courses to slots automatically by mapping credits → required weekly slots.

Ensures labs get consecutive slots.

Faculty Mapping

Faculty linked to chosen courses.

AI checks workload balance + availability.

If conflict → suggest alternate faculty.

Room/Lab Allocation

Based on student strength vs room capacity.

If no room fits → suggest splitting batch / alternate slot.

AI ensures no double booking of labs/rooms.

Student Multidisciplinary Choice Handling

Students select their course basket (Major + Minor + Skills + Value Added).

AI merges choices into personal timetable.

If clash occurs:

System generates a “Conflict Report” with details (Course A vs Course B).

Suggests alternate course/slot if available.

If no possibility → prompt student to reselect from available options.

C. Output Timetable
Admin View → Full College Timetable (all courses, all slots).

Faculty View → Personal schedule with workload summary.

Student View → Personalized, clash-free timetable.

Exportable to PDF/Excel.

D. Example Flow
Admin sets slot = 55 min, day = 8 slots, working hours = 8:30–5:30.

Course DBMS (3 credits) → requires 3 slots/week.

Faculty Dr. X chosen → AI ensures workload ≤ 12 hours/week.

Room capacity check: 80 students enrolled → AI assigns a hall of capacity 100.

Student chooses DBMS (Major) + Statistics (Minor) + AI (Skill).

AI maps into timetable.

If AI lab clashes with Statistics theory → system suggests alternate AI section.
